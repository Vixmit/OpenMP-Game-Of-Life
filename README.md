# OpenMP-Game-Of-Life
This is a simple parallel implementation of the Conway's Game of Life using OpenMP

There are 2 implementations: serial and parallel that I used to measure the performance between those 2 versions by variying the size of the matrix.

The Conway's Game of Life is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
